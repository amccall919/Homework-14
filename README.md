Belly Button Challenge

## Synopsis of Project
In this project, we created an interactive dashboard to explore the "Belly Button Biodiversity" dataset from NC State. The dataset highlights that a small number of microbial species were found in over 70% of people, while the majority were relatively rare. The dashboard features bar graphs showcasing the top 10 bacteria cultures identified, as well as bubble charts visualizing the number of bacterial cultures per sample. This project was both enjoyable and eye-opening, revealing the vast diversity of bacteria that can exist in the belly button.
